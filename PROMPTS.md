## 2024-12-07 - Initial Project Request

So, okay, make a Chrome extension which sits on top of your Twitter feed, like your X feed, and reads the content of the page. And what it should do is two things. Firstly, it should extract all the tweets that you read into a database of all tweets. All users of this Chrome extension. It'll ingest their own feeds.

It'll remember whose feed it came from. And have all the meta information on the tweets that it can access just by looking at the screen easily. And then, that's one part of it. And then the second part of it, which can be independent of this. But it's also synergistic, which is it just takes your X feed and it filters it according to your own algorithm, which you as a user can provide. And the default algorithm can be something like look for items that will raise your vibration and activate you and enlighten you instead of outraging you.

And there can be two versions of this. One merely filters the feed that you already have and basically hides the items that are on your feed that would not do that. And maybe this is the MVP, maybe we start with this here. And maybe it fetches more or something if it needs to, but that's also step one and a half. And then the second version of this app can take the aggregated set of all the users of this app's items and basically bring your own newsfeed, have your own newsfeed algorithm which will surface tweets from this custom shared database, this open Twitter, open X database, which should be viewable elsewhere.

Anyway, maybe. Let's start with the first step of it, the first version of this.
