AI-powered feed filter that surfaces uplifting content and hides outrage-bait on X/Twitter and Google News.

## Detailed Description
Transform your social media experience with XFeed Paradise - an AI-powered extension that brings peace to your feed.

**How it works:**
XFeed Paradise uses AI sentiment analysis to score every tweet and news article you see. Content that's uplifting, enlightening, or genuinely informative gets highlighted. Outrage-bait, doom-scrolling fodder, and toxic content gets filtered out.

**Key Features:**

- AI-Powered Scoring: Uses Groq's fast AI to analyze sentiment in real-time
- Customizable Threshold: Set your own vibe filter level from -100 to +100
- Multiple Filter Modes: Hide, dim, or collapse low-vibe content
- Visual Vibe Badges: See scores on tweets at a glance
- Works on X/Twitter and Google News
- Privacy-First: All filtering happens locally, your data stays yours
- Optional Community Sync: Contribute to a shared curated feed (anonymously)

**Why XFeed Paradise?**

Social media algorithms optimize for engagement, not your wellbeing. Outrage and conflict drive clicks, but they also drive anxiety and polarization. XFeed Paradise flips the script - now YOUR feed optimizes for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse.

**Free to Use:**
- Works out of the box with our shared Groq API key
- Or bring your own free Groq API key for unlimited usage

**Open Source:**
